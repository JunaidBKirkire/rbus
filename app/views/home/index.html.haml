  .faq
    %h3 How does it work, exactly?
    rBus works very simply. First, we gather the commute details of people. Then, when we find enough of them going from the same place to the same place, we 
    start running buses between those points. If we find say 200 people, it means we can run 10 twenty-seater buses on that route, which gives you ample
    flexibility in terms of timings. We wire up the buses with GPS and voila - your personal public transport system!
    %h3 Can we have rBus in my city?
    rBus is currently operational only in Mumbai as that's where I live. However, if you wish to start an rBus service in your city I will provide the 
    software to manage the service there. You will have to run it under your own brand name (not rBus) and you can pay me something for the 
    software platform.  Get in touch if you'd like to provide a similar service where you live. What you will need is
    %ul
      %li latitude and longitude information for all the points you want to provide services at. Unfortunately without this information, routing becomes impossible.
      %li relationships with bus vendors and the ability to ensure that buses reach on time, are well maintained and so on.
    I will provide
    %ul
      %li The software to manage user accounts, preferences etc.
      %li Payment gateway
      %li GPS, ticketing and related technology
      %li Complaints system
      %li Routing algorithms, etc.
    and anything else to do with technology required to run this service effeciently
