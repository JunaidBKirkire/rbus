  .faq
    %h3 How does it work, exactly?
    If you leave us your commute details and spread the word far and wide amongst your social network, we are confident that we can find another 19 
    people who share your commute. Once we find them, we'll let you know and soon after, a bus will arrive every morning at a 
    bus-stop of your choice with a seat on it for you. The more people we find, the more buses we can run on your route. i.e. if we find a mere 200 people,
    we can run ten 20-seater buses, one every ten minutes or so, which gives you ample flexibility in your commute time. Running a bit late in the morning? 
    No problem. Just let us know and you can catch a later bus. Meeting finished early? Log on and switch to an earlier return trip. Magic!
